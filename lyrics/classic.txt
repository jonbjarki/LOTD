This is a classic, ayy
I've been in my bag, been in my bag, been in my bag, been in my bag
This is a classic, ayy
Jersey's on my back, it's on my back, it's on my back, it's on my back
Gotta be classy
Something bout the way this goes, make it feel some type of way
Cause it be speaking to they souls
This is a classic
Sick of fighting with you bums, work my craft, watch you laugh
As long as momma likes this song, this is a classic

I've been on a new wave, no hit, classic
Going on for two days, floating, magic
Sage lit, got the bass hitting and I'm tapped in
Tryna change the world, this the bullshit before you step in
I let you be the judge, I get plenty in the tank
Give the music to the world and hope the jury gets me paid
This ain't for me, I'm bring Jersey when I break
Just because I had this flow, leaving frozen like Russian banks
This ironic, all the doors they slammed on me I record it
Turn them into snares for beats that makes the songs that take me over
Talk about a plot twist, fuck the fame
You can't hang that over my head, I'm just here to bring realness to what you spoiled, damn

And I ain't saying that we perfect
But we damn close, I must say
And let em' tell us we ain't worth shit (Why?)
Cause they gon' hear this beat like, yooo!

This is a classic, ayy
I've been in my bag, been in my bag, been in my bag, been in my bag
This is a classic, ayy
Jersey's on my back, it's on my back, it's on my back, it's on my back
Gotta be classy
Something bout the way this goes, make it feel some type of way
Cause it be speaking to they souls
This is a classic
Sick of fighting with you bums, work my craft, watch you laugh

Senior year of high school, I was sitting front of class
Walked up to my math teacher, told him I'ma miss the next
Couple days of school, I'm flying to LA because my raps
Make a face like I was joking in [?] of the whole class can hear him
Laughing, why he said, "You better hope this pays the bills, though"
Sounds like someone had a dream they never chased and still cold
To be honest, those the types of people I don't feel for
I just think he mad his wife gets more pleasure from her dildo
I don't care about a goddamn thing, you ain't shit
Watch for when I cop the droptop range and lane switch
And I ain't saying this the reason that this chip sit on my shoulder
But he showed me how it looks when you quit before it's over

Used to break my soul, I just played the bluff
Having you thinking I fold
I got so much left to do, just get money, [unintelligible]
And now I might leave the stu' and tell my family that we cool (Ayy)

This is a classic, ayy
I've been in my bag, been in my bag, been in my bag, been in my bag
This is a classic, ayy
Jersey on my back, it's on my back, it's on my back, it's on my back
Gotta be classy
Something bout the way this goes, make it feel some type of way
Cause it be speaking to they souls
This is a classic
Sick of fighting with you bums, work my craft, watch you laugh
As long as momma likes this song, this is a classic
