Ayy
I'm betting on me
You don't want to start this war
Watch out you gon bleed
I promise you all a war you brought it to me
Go head bring 'em all and more
Lil bitch I'm a dog and I'm starving for it
I'm laughing though you the one stuck to the leash

I just can't be beat
Like a man that's been castrated
FU like John, you ain't ever seen a problem and
You still haven't nah cause you can't see me
Pressure built like a crock pot will I stop? Nah
Keep it cookin bitch I'm top notch neva flop nah
But I flip a little guap put it in my stock now
And [?] pop pop and I say haha
And trust I know the game is so inflated so much fake shit
Ask me how I cope with hatred notes and flames
Is sitting in my phone so patient load and aim em'
The hate build me nah there's no cage could tame me
I've been floatin like a butterfly stingin em on beats
Imma [?] old school like Ali in the ring
Been a king even when I ain't even know what that means
Now I live to show the world you can live in what you dream (Woo)
It make me think about all of the times
I was laughed at for trying to do something different
Everyone's eyes do not see the shit mine do
It's frustrating but I have grown to love it
Cause it means that I'm wired to believe and acquire
The visions I see won't stop till I'm living it
Most of you can't even act like you know what that's like
So why am I listening? (Ayy)

I'm betting on me (Get the fuck out of here, I'm betting on me)
You don't want to start this war
Watch out you gon bleed (Watch out you gon bleed)
I promise you all a war you brought it to me (You brought it to me, ayy)
Go head bring 'em all and more
Lil bitch I'm a dog and I'm starving for it
I'm laughing though you the one stuck to the leash

The only reason you inspire me
Is cause I'll never let me live like how you be
Talkin proud but you hide from me
Lil boy make it obvious I'm what you aspire to be
Boutta unload clippin like the 808 [?] gun smoke
I really be damned to let a mothafucka come close
World is in my hand I always knew it but I'm almost right there
Bitch I'm right there
I won't let
No soul in the way of my path
Used to be at rattle from the snakes in my grass
If they bitin', then the mothafucka I'm bitin right back
Me not fucking with you bring me W's and I laugh
Ha ha
I'm everything that you're not
Life jolly, no fa la la la
I'm thankful praise God
[?] thinkin' you get the last word funny how they feelin
Got a track record beatin' all the odds I was given
One thing to let [?] stop but I didn't
Shit I'm hard headed fuck you bitch I know this I'll admit it
I've been down bad real tears streaming down my face
Not a stream or a [?] or a dollar to my name
Then it clicked, I'm not shit I do this all the way I say
Give me life or give me death but I know one thing won't change (Ayy)

I'm betting on me (Come on, I'm betting on me)
You don't want to start this war
Watch out you gon bleed (Watch out you gon bleed)
I promise you all a war you brought it to me (You brought it to me, ayy)
Go head bring 'em all and more
Lil bitch I'm a dog and I'm starving for it
I'm laughing though you the one stuck to the leash
