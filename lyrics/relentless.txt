Ayy
Bitch I wasn't born to listen I was born relentless, made a promise I never fold
She can get [?], and I ain't far from winning, give a damn bitch, I'm in my zone
I set my plays and make my own space [?] on my team for the pick and roll
You do everything, it [seem rich?], but in reality you going broke
And now what you think bitch? Come hop in the ring bitch
Now you fucking with a king bitch, you hear the bell ding, then boom
You not what you think bitch, come hop in the ring bitch
Now you fucking with a king bitch (Look), you hear the bell ding, then boom
[Verse 1]
I know I'm young but the vision lined up, and I ain't never known anything about luck
This ain't about me lil' homie, it's about us, city going be eatin' cause the goals that I hunt
But for thе record, all the Jersеy is on lock, though
But don't tell em', I'ma show em' how I got them
Not many [?] where I'm from cause I'ma stop some
But I be damned to do the same, it's not an option
I can never let a small town mind can be falling behind
Must be tripping, I ain't living from nobody else
Out your mind if you bout that life, how I'm crazy if I change your lifestyle I live?
I remember dad, sleeping on the couch, rack shit in the cabinets to the house
Put memories there, [been what?] I'm about
Things I love, things I hate it, but the [?] who I'm now and

I make it look easy, I make it look like a piece of cake
I [?] brought my family on my side, I'm tryna lead the way
Bitch, no time for stressors, second guessing, I leave it to faith
I know one day champagne glasses happen when we [make it good?]

Bitch I wasn't born [?] and I was born relentless, made a promise I never fold
She can get [?], and I ain't far from winning, give a damn bitch, I'm in my zone
I set my plays and make my own space [?] on my team for the pick and roll
You do everything, it [seem rich?], but in reality you going broke
And now what you think bitch? Come hop in the ring bitch
Now you fucking with a king bitch, you hear the bell ding, then boom
You not what you think bitch, come hop in the ring bitch
Now you fucking with a king bitch, you hear the bell ding, then boom (Look)

[Verse 2]
We all feel the highs and lows, remember when they said I suck like indicing hoes?
Now I walk in, it's like seeing a ghost, pale faces whiter than younger Mike Tyson
Child and friends with the bugs on the ground, that's what happens when you grow from the dirt
Remember talking to the caterpillars, one was hurt and then jealous of [?] the [?]
They just fly where ever with they pretty feathers, how the fuck they get them? What am I gonna do?
I ain't seen em' for a minute after till' I found em' hanging, breaking out his cocoon
Seen his wings open and he flew from the tree like he ain't never thought he get the feeling what it be like
Said he flying south, gotta soak him in a dream like [?] say and I'ma go to get my wings saved

[Pre-Chorus]
You make it look easy, you make it look like a piece of cake
Just keep all your family by your side so you can lead the way
Bitch, no time for stressors, second guessing, just leave it to faith
I know one day champagne glasses happen when you [make it good?]

[Chorus]
Bitch I wasn't born [?] and I was born relentless, made a promise I never fold
She can get [?], and I ain't far from winning, give a damn bitch, I'm in my zone
I set my plays and make my own space [?] on my team for the pick and roll
You do everything, it [seem rich?], but in reality you going broke
And now what you think bitch? Come hop in the ring bitch
Now you fucking with a king bitch, you hear the bell ding, then boom
You not what you think bitch, come hop in the ring bitch
Now you fucking with a king bitch, you hear the bell ding, then boom
