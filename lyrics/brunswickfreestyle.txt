Gotta tuck these in

Ay, I'm on my boom bap shit, in my room rap shit
Built a business from my bedroom they like who that kid?
Same room I had the dream where I should do that shit
But fuck it if I talk about it, they gon’ boo that shit
But I ain't here for the same shit that most dudes are
Notoriety and pussy fuels most of they hearts
They rap about it, that's cool, the can do what they want
Just don’t be mad when I keep rapping 'bout me proving 'em wrong
'Cause that's my purpose, I don't work for surface level
Success, I want this shit to run deep, pass the purse to who next
I guess that means I'll deal with sharks if these the waters I'll test
But I’ve been broken for a minute, let’s just see what comes next
It's been a long road, you might think I’m 'bout to quit
But bitch I'm on go, never trip about a bitch
Since you all hoes, I'll never let you in between
Where I wanna go, unless I want it too
That’s for my real dogs, my not afraid to feel dogs
The dudes who take the bad ways and ditch 'em so they can build love
But if you ever say that out loud, they'll say you're real soft
Even though connection is medicine when we feel lost
Bring it back, I ain't really tryna go too far
But stating facts, those are what I call to my go-to bars
And big cap is all I been seeing from you know who you ares
But energy never dies, it won't be long till you're gone
That's word to Sway, he told me that before I left from the station
He had me on and I was nervous, I ain't let the storm shake me
We had a moment off air, an email I had written
So he can get me on there, I had it printed on the paper
Little did he know there was a date, the top of page
I saw him see it, "Oh damn, you wrote this to me as a kid"
I dapped him up and paid my hommage, told him, "You don't understand
You showed me proof of manifesting what's inside my head"
So please excuse me if I do this in a way that's not influenced
By majority of people in this rap game
You can keep the foreign coups, that jewelry owns you more than you
You're late on payments that advanced is all you got paid, damn
So sad, no I can't hold back
Got some things that I regret too, I wish to go back, but I can't
Got no choice but give some beats a toe tag
And use regret to fuel the fire got lit under my ass
This music gonna last more than my lifetime
This ain't a phase, long haul, it's a lifetime
How could this go wrong as long as I'm in the right mind?
I'm gonna fall, I just care about the heights climb
I've accepted how it feels to be uncomfortable
That's why lyrics be giving 'em chills when they bumping 'em
It's 'cause I don't acknowledge what I'm saying, I just run with it
No filter on what's real, so they know there is someone with 'em, damn
Sick to my stomach, I been ripping, they running
Try and bring me down, I have my fun, they hate see it, but fuck it
I know I'm bound, never the plumbing become what I summon
And bitch I found a different level of me that I discovered
From falling down, can't keep my pride high if I'm going into business
Shit might work but it might not, and you'll grow to know the difference
It's the ones that never stop, if they fail, they get back in it
Keep on trying till the plot starts to twist
Rewrite the script, I hit the glitch then write a hit that hits the charts
Hitting people in our way from hitting peaks that seem too far
But they might think it's out of reach, we all believe 'em, that's the cause
My drive just comes from my potential, I'm competing with my thoughts
People showing signs of nerves, I see the sweat up on they face
Understood but this a game, there's a trophy I'm tryna take
And hard feelings our feelings, I don't hold 'cause all the weight
That's on my back right now already not worth the time they just hating
And look the kid still snapping, I'on even need a hook
Here's the thing, I'm aware of my career and how it looks
All I needed was some time 'cause growing up with this was tough
But now I see the vision clear and y'all gon' see it with me, trust
