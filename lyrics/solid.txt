If I call you, I know you gon' pick up
You don't play no games when I need you
You right there, I love it
Book a plane up, it's a long flight
Bit of pesos, I ain't Bezos, but I know it's right
I'll find some money in my couch, yeah
'Cause you solid, you solid yeah, you solid
I love the way you hold me down
'Cause you solid, you solid yeah, you solid
When I need you, I know you around

Ayy
What would I do if the world kept going but I ain't get you?
Probably down bad, no future in my lens
Had me imagining kids in the yard with a view
Knew to always let God do the work for me
Let Him be to do His job, then He started coming
Happened slow from where we started, nеver saw it coming
'Cause look at wherе the fuck we are, baby we really does it
I don't really mean to flex on rest of the world
But you stay through the test, you invest in my girl
Hoodie, hair up, put some sweat in you, girl
And the way you fit your dress putting stress in them girls
That's the way it got to be sometime
I'm just glad it's you and I
Hard times could do, I'm fine
I'll make it out because I know that

If I call you, I know you gon' pick up
You don't play no games when I need you
You right there, I love it
Book a plane up, it's a long flight
Bit of pesos, I ain't Bezos, but I know it's right
I'll find some money in my couch, yeah
'Cause you solid, you solid yeah, you solid
I love the way you hold me down
'Cause you solid, you solid yeah, you solid
When I need you, I know you around

You so dependable, Mrs. Incredible
Eyes get perked up at the thought of you next to me
I'm gon' protect the two, ain't no neglecting you
I learned my lesson, move steady on steady
I put all my faith into you, now I'm facing the truth
It's a feeling I don't like to feel
I'm known to break and lose anything stable through
All of the problems I keep to myself
Fucked up so many times and you let it go
Understand I never been good with love
But I give my time and you know I try
And it's the one thing you looking for
And you know if you bawling and crying
You call me, I'm siding
Give to you all that
I've gotten from you and more, because

If I call you, I know you gon' pick up
You don't play no games when I need you
You right there, I love it
Book a plane up, it's a long flight
Bit of pesos, I ain't Bezos, but I know it's right
I'll find some money in my couch, yeah
'Cause you solid, you solid yeah, you solid
I love the way you hold me down
'Cause you solid, you solid yeah, you solid
When I need you, I know you around, yeah
