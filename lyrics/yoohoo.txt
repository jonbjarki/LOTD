Yeah You talking down down down
You talking down on me, ay

You talking down on me, I just been eating it up
'Cause I'm not what you're used to
Why you all milking this shit that ain't real
For a check like you working at Yoo-hoo
I ain't never been about it
So maybe my name won't get up with them new dudes
Never act out for the fame
If you playing that game get the fuck out my face
Bitch, get the fuck out my face
I ain't got no time of day (nah)
I'll do what you say I can't
Won't let you make me feel ashamed (nah)
All I, all I do is win
Like do that, I'll buy you a drink
Let me have my fun and live
While you do what you think is best

Ay, the haters are only fans
I feel like a naked bitch is getting rich from it
But I'm a holy man
Thankful to God for my blessings and those who pray it plummets
'Cause I need them all
Pride hit heavy when they see things fall
But the story of my life is to keep shit going
No matter the sacrifices, I just need this so
Badly, I'll never sell my soul although they been asking
Need to be the one controlling all of the action
I put the pedal to the floor, you sit in the backseat
Why don't you sit that ass down? Contradictive-ass clown
You do what you can to make the big man proud
Then you go and guess it all when you run your damn mouth
I'ma run your ass down, I'm here

You talking down on me, I just been eating it up
'Cause I'm not what you're used to
Why you all milking this shit that ain't real
For a check like you working at Yoo-hoo
I ain't never been about it
So maybe my name won't get up with them new dudes
Never act out for the fame
If you playing that game get the fuck out my face
Bitch, get the fuck out my face
I ain't got no time of day (nah)
I'll do what you say I can't
Won't let you make me feel ashamed (nah)
All I, all I do is win
Like do that, I'll buy you a drink
Let me have my fun and live
While you do what you think is best

You know how I be when it's crunch time
I just thought it would be like weird to do it like loud over [unintelligible]
Yeah

Yeah, you know how I be when it's crunch time
You and your whole team on the front lines
Only adds sauce to the motherfucking punchline
I would never want your life 'cause I love mine
Sick of living life with feelings of envy
The picture I saw clear was really just empty
It's all in my head, why compare me to deadbeats
Was tricking me into thinking that I wasn't ready
But I'm readier than ever
Don't compare me to whoever, family we stick together like boom
Now you're leaving in a stretcher
'Cause you've broken under pressure, can't believe you think you better
Like hm, AK 'boutta open up shop
Grand opening, I see the non-believers outside
I cut the ribbon like our ties
I know I'm something you despise, damn

You talking down on me, I just been eating it up
'Cause I'm not what you're used to
Why you all milking this shit that ain't real
For a check like you working at Yoo-hoo
I ain't never been about it
So maybe my name won't get up with them new dudes
Never act out for the fame
If you playing that game get the fuck out my face
Bitch, get the fuck out my face
I ain't got no time of day (nah)
I'll do what you say I can't
Won't let you make me feel ashamed (nah)
All I, all I do is win
Like do that, I'll buy you a drink
Let me have my fun and live
While you do what you think is best
