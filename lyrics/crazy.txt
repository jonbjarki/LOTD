I've been spending nights working 'til the morning
The morning, yeah
Only reason I have is 'cause I see something they don't, yeah
They don't, yeah, ayy
I been getting heat like crazy
They be telling me I'm crazy, ayy
I need so much me time lately
That's why every beat back crazy

Ever since this shit started, felt like things often my mental
I never felt like I'm doing enough of what I am meant to
Went and hired some help like fifty said in '03
I worked my way out that hell now all I'm left with is heat in different ways
'Cause I can go and give you something you could vibe to
Mindless ear candy, hidden message you could find
Two weeks go by, drop some other shit that changed your life
Who told you not to try? You should beat his ass
Every two weeks, that's a plan
Bitch, I'm an artist, I need to my music jelly it jam
My brain keep dumping, I reload
I'm different, homie, I'm him, consistent hitters
They judge me, I'm airing (aaron) out
Whoever's hating ass talk down on me
But for now I've been

I've been spending nights working 'til the morning
The morning, yeah
Only reason I have is 'cause I see something they don't, yeah
They don't, yeah, ayy
I been getting heat like crazy
They be telling me I'm crazy, ayy
I need so much me time lately
That's why every beat back crazy

Ayy, I had to let go and let be, this is me
All or nothin', heart straight layin' on my sleeve
Music speaks, talk somethin'
We all gamblin' with time, I'm never blind
Small budges do it all 'cause I like tryin'
If I fail, ah, fuck it
That's what make it all worthwhile, won't ever change me
Needed time with my thoughts, piled up 'til I can't breathe
Now me again, at least that's how I feel like, fuck the other shit
The floods coming, this is real life, heads up

I've been spending nights working 'til the morning
The morning, yeah
Only reason I have is 'cause I see something they don't, yeah
They don't, yeah, ayy
I been getting heat like crazy
They be telling me I'm crazy, ayy
I need so much me time lately
That's why every beat back crazy
