Used to let it rock, now it's too much
Feel like we on different sides because one of us is growing
Crossing every line that I drew, yeah
Jealousy is in your eyes and it's showing
I be damned if I let anyone show
Show me all the signs if someone I don't want close
And it's hurting my soul
I honestly don't want to let go

Oh no, please don't let me find out
I'm the one that's gotta cut some people out my life now
Everybody got they purpose, but you serve your time now
This ain't what I want, put in my heart I know it's right now
Oh no, please don't let me find out
I'm the one that's gotta cut some people out my life now
Everybody got they purpose, but you serve your time now
This ain't what I want, put in my heart I know it's right now, yeah

It's hard for me to watch you dealing cope with insecurities
Like putting people down to feed the ego but it's hurting
The ones you calling over when you home but I know certainly
The second we ain't close, you going ghost, I read you thoroughly
I know you got some demons upstairs
But you never open up because you scared, I know
But I promise you don't really know fear
Just imagine because of you, we ain't here, oh no
But it's got to that, now we thought to
Back when we was playing ball and every single shot of cash
You was mad cause shit that small would move the spotlight off of that
And we was running bigger games, you play like five rings on your hand
Cause you all about that competition
Well if you want it like you talk it, then fine let's get it
Don't music give my face because you know my chests got commas in it
Act like you have before me but show me deep down you prayin' (Ayy), ehh

Oh no, please don't let me find out
I'm the one that's gotta cut some people out my life now
Everybody got they purpose, but you serve your time now
This ain't what I want, put in my heart I know it's right now
Oh no, please don't let me find out
I'm the one that's gotta cut some people out my life now
Everybody got they purpose, but you serve your time now
This ain't what I want, put in my heart I know it's right now, yeah

You was in my corner, now you praying on my downfall
OG told me, "Watch my circle the more I count em"
Mines ain't never wrong, now I show em' to clear the past now
Facing this means cutting off ties cause I know this is bad for my
State of mind, watching every set cause you been sneak dissing
Throw dirt on my name because you hate the fact that my teeth glistening
Happy dreams I'm folding cause I grind and for these seat
I sit in beige leather, a top ten, either way I see it, I'm winning
You don't know what this life, but I could teach you to get it
You pride too high to hide, you rather hate me then be winning
But I don't want to give any more time
Hurts the heart of my soul and mind and

I be damned if I let anyone show
Show me all the signs if someone I don't want close
And it's hurting my soul
I honestly don't want to let go (Ayy)

Oh no, please don't let me find out
I'm the one that's gotta cut some people out my life now
Everybody got they purpose, but you serve your time now
This ain't what I want, put in my heart I know it's right now
Oh no, please don't let me find out
I'm the one that's gotta cut some people out my life now
Everybody got they purpose, but you serve your time now
This ain't what I want, put in my heart I know it's right now, yeah
