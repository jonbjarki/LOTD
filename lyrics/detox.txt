I think I need a detox
Getting sick of it, messing around with these thots
I just hit and forget it, I've got amnesia
They love the way I turn the G-Wagon into the gspot, yeah
I think I need a detox
Getting sick of it, messing around with these thots
I just hit and forget it, I've got amnesia
They love the way I turn the G-Wagon into the gspot, yeah

All of my life I had something to prove
Now, I wake up, do whatever I choose
Girls left on read and the checks come in blue
Can't get distracted, been thinking about too much stop hittin my phone
But they know I won't say no
Said she flying out to LA in the morn
Hit it once, send her plane right back home
You've been making me feel so useless
I've been out duck-duck-goosing
Think I done too much
I will never choose love
You don't wanna lose us

I think I need a detox
Getting sick of it, messing around with these thots
I just hit and forget it, I've got amnesia
They love the way I turn the G-Wagon into the gspot, yeah

I never thought too much
Would be too much for me
I just want company
Lately I know it's been fucking with me
Every time I go to right any wrong
Feel like I'm fighting a fight that can't be won
Say it ain't right you might be right but nah
You couldn't last a night in life alone, and now
You might also like

You've been making me so useless
I've been out duck-duck-goosing
Think I done too much
I will never choose love
You don't wanna lose us

TBH, I just wanna fuck
PCH, in the Cedes truck
Been too long and I don't wanna go home cause
