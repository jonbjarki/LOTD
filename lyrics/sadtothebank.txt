The money is stackin'
I been in the lab getting shots, about practice
Guess that's the reaction
You fall off the quickest, we blow up the fastest
Good thing I've been active, I been on my hustle, my bully my Casper
'Cause I just stay ghost 'til I have one
I'm sad to the bank 'til I'm laughing ho
All I'm seein' is one comma, I need three of that
Two could do me plenty, every penny came from these hands
I don't really fuck with gossip, I don't need that
So I just stay ghost 'til I have one
I'm sad to the bank 'til I'm laughing ho

Cryin' in tears and one day I'mma say we're the ones that I cried, that done got me this far
Ain't even trying still spit with a climate to highest and fire from here to the stars
When you this high, you get lonely, still I never found no coffee
She want me treat her like Rosie, put a ring around her finger
She usually like to move slowly
All eyes on me, cameras on me, farther I see then the farther I'm runnin'
If you with me, it's all in a leaf, you ain't ballin' if you ain't giving nothin'
It's why we ain't making room, no time to wait for you, uh-uh
We known to break the rules, I just tell fate to choose and I pray that

The money is stackin'
I been in the lab getting shots, about practice
Guess that's the reaction
You fall off the quickest, we blow up the fastest
Good thing I've been active, I been in my hustle, my bully my Casper
'Cause I just stay ghost 'til I have one
I'm sad to the bank 'til I'm laughing ho
All I'm seein' is one comma, I need three of that
Two could do me plenty, every penny came from these hands
I don't really fuck with gossip, I don't need that
So I just stay ghost 'til I have one
I'm sad to the bank 'til I'm laughing ho (Look)

Isolated, never jaded, I pray that the blessin's go all around
I don't need Lasik, to see they fakin', but send her my love, like feel shawty now
Your foot on the brake and you stallin', everybody movin' forward
Back in my mind where I leave you, but I know I'll never gon' need ya
So I will not say shit, when we touch down
We don't even ever have to talk but I'm sittin' on your playlist
Turn it up loud, barely catch me at the club 'cause I'm busy chasin' bucks
From the basement, to a bussdown
Where it's going but it ain't yet, it's a flood now
Let em' all say shit, gives a fuck about anything you say
Cause baby what nowâ€” and the-the-the-the

The money is stackin'
I been in the lab getting shots, about practice
Guess that's the reaction
You fall off the quickest, we blow up the fastest
Good thing I've been active, I been in my hustle, my bully my Casper
'Cause I just stay ghost 'til I have one
I'm sad to the bank 'til I'm laughing ho
