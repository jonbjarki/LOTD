Feel like I'm at rock bottom, not a dollar in my pocket
Every time I feel okay, I just point me to all my problems
Why the fuck can't I just stop it? It's so fucking toxic
How can I wanna be okay so badly and still make no progress (Make no progress)
And some days are worse than others, I admit (Rock bottom)
I'm there for you, of course, but I'm who I forget (Rock bottom)
I never show up for myself, it might seem like I'm doing well
But you dodge me if I ever let you in (Rock bottom)

Put my life in God's hands and pray to Him that he don't drop it
At this point, I feel so heartless, blame the life I'm stuck in, fuck this
No one ever would survive if my road was what they walk in
Why thе fuck would I tell someone? Lеt my problems be my problems
That's my issue from the jump, I never talk about shit
Throughout my life, I never thought that anybody'd understand
Then I picked the microphone up and I got it off my chest
And found so many people fighting demons too, now I'm with them
It's us against the world
Now I know what this 'bout 'cause I know how it be
When the lights go down and the thoughts come out
Feel like no way out and you just can't breathe
Tryna get calmed down, but your eyes bawl out
'Til you feel like you're drowning in all of your tears
'Til you fall asleep, then you wake from dreams
Then you feel like shit 'cause it's make-believe
And then it's fuck it, I'm done, I'm going back to sleep
Don't wake me up if you see the sun, that's my biggest enemy
Give me time, I'll figure it out
No, really, I'm fine, don't think I need any help
Just let me rot 'cause it ain't like I— (Fuck)

Feel like I'm at rock bottom, not a dollar in my pocket
Every time I feel okay, I just point me to all my problems
Why the fuck can't I just stop it? It's so fucking toxic
How can I wanna be okay so badly and still make no progress (Make no progress)
And some days are worse than others, I admit (Rock bottom)
I'm there for you, of course, but I'm who I forget (Rock bottom)
I never show up for myself, it might seem like I'm doing well
But you dodge me if I ever let you in (Rock bottom)

What's it like getting out of bed?
Rubbing the crust out of your eyes and feeling refreshed?
Last night, I went to bed around 7 p.m.​
Woke up at noon feeling tired, mad it happened again
I woke up
Goddamn it, now I gotta get up acting like I'm fine
Let my face show motivation while this hell invades my mind
Embrace the struggles, that's what makes you, but what happens when you try
And they become the closest thing to your existence? Sick of trying
What's the point if it's a cycle that I know all too well?
Maybe the fact it's consistent gives me comfort and it's hell
I made friends with the monsters even though I hate how it feels
They're all I've known for so long, it makes it so hard to rebel
But if I keep believing, maybe one day something will change
I only try 'cause dying means my name will carry that shame
I have a family that loves me even if I can't say the same about myself
So time will tell if I get out, I—

Feel like I'm at rock bottom, not a dollar in my pocket
Every time I feel okay, I just point me to all my problems
Why the fuck can't I just stop it? It's so fucking toxic
How can I wanna be okay so badly and still make no progress (Make no progress)
And some days are worse than others, I admit (Rock bottom)
I'm there for you, of course, but I'm who I forget (Rock bottom)
I never show up for myself, it might seem like I'm doing well
But you dodge me if I ever let you in (Rock bottom)
