I'm coming for throats
Don't give a fuck who you are, I'ma light the bitch up
Who do you think you are, bitch? Watch your tone
Your jaw could move but you don't follow through, you in the dust
Leave you forgotten, the fuck is you talking to? I had enough
Watch your step before you cross me, I'll be looking both ways
You just stay up in your lane 'cause this a different roadway
No forgiveness for the gimmicks you tried playing, no way
Bunch of sloppy carbon copies, put 'em all in cold graves (Ayy, look)

I feel like it's a groove I'm really hitting with these songs
Sometimes gotta move different switches flipping on
You can hate it or love it, the underdog gon' bе on top
Fifty cents to my name and I'm praying I don't flop
This shit hard though but this that life so I gotta go hardеr than how this fights
And it gets so hard when you don't think alike with those that you brought on to the team, I might
Have to make a few changes, now I feel anxious
Made me feel brainless, now it's real dangerous
When I look at the clock and I see all the time spent here, been a while and it hurts me to see
Dollar signs on my mind never what it's about something changed me a lot but I'm working on me
Used to be more confident in my vision, now I hate everything I think I believe
Now I'm hard on myself, lost in this hell, think I can't be shit if I move how I see
Had a feeling that this time was gonna come
But it's here and I'm still grateful for the lessons that it taught
And I tried ignoring all the signs but it was written in the walls
Now I'm back to who I am 'cause I can't take that shit no more, fuck

I'm coming for throats (Goddamn)
Don't give a fuck who you are, I'ma light the bitch up
Who do you think you are, bitch? Watch your tone
Your jaw could move but you don't follow through, you in the dust
Leave you forgotten, the fuck is you talking to? I had enough
Watch your step before you cross me, Hope you looking both ways
You just stay up in your lane 'cause it's a different roadway
No forgiveness for the gimmicks you tried playing, no way
Bunch of sloppy carbon copies, put 'em all in cold graves

This be hitting home, I ain't lying though
I'm just tryna make my name known, feel like they trying to
Get up in my way, they all keep saying that I'm trying to
Do too much because they know they sheep and I'm a lion to 'em
Biggest threat they ever seen, intimidation at its finest
The king of the jungle with my queen, her name is lioness
I came with a flame they can't contain unless they die in it
They pride won't let 'em walk away so i jump in and annihilate
The Best On Earth like Bia and Russ
Ain't no beef one-on-one, you can see me in Rust
Classic intervention, we got things to discuss
Only your problems stemming from you not believing your gut
And that ain't on me, I say that 'cause I feel you projecting
When I listen how you speak, that was me, I was stressing
But now I see I might not be here for forever, I'm getting used to being
Completely me, that starts with [?]

I'm coming for throats (Nah)
Don't give a fuck who you are, I'ma light the bitch up (Ooh)
Who do you think you are, bitch? Watch your tone (Mmh)
You jaw could move but you don't follow through, you in the dust
Leave you forgotten, the fuck is you talking to? I had enough (Oh)
Watch your step before you cross me, I'll be looking both ways
You just stay up in your lane 'cause this a different roadway
No forgiveness for the gimmicks you tried playing, no way
Bunch of sloppy carbon copies, put 'em all in cold graves
