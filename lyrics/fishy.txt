Something ’bout this fishy, I ain’t one to point no fingers
And I hate conspiracies, but I get why they all triggered
What I seen, I need some answers and I see why they minds linger
Think it’s more about ticket sales than safety of who paid to get there

It’s a festival, I get it, but they screaming, “Stop the show”
Light's is on and you can’t see shit but excuses kinda slow
I know stage view of the crowd is just a massive silhouette
But if you heard ’em yell for help
Then why’d you say that’s what they get for popping out?
Tryna rage while they all fighting for their life
And I know because it is the haters out there in the hype
And it’s probably not your fault
I’m sure you’re hurt ’cause people died
But things I’ve seen online don’t look too good
It hurt some lives, I feel for you

‘Cause if I did a show and this happened I’d probably go insane
Pressure on me ’cause it happened at my show so I’m to blame
Even if it wasn’t something I condone from on this stage
Never something I would mean if I had told ’em all to rage
I’d be angry at the fans that hopped the gates like it’s a stunt
People falling from the surge of people rushing to the front
Disregarding anybody, if I seen that, I say
"Cut, stop the show, ain't no procedure helping me, then how the fuck?

But let me stop, maybe I’m thinking too deep about this
After all, festivals crazy and people I’ve met
Who be going all the time told me some shit about them
And it’s the fear that comes to mind, getting anxious and now I’m sweating
Wasn’t there, so I can’t say more that I know from videos
On a panic shit is tragic, pray for those ain't making home
Hope the mass knows what happened and who needs to see get shown
And there’s some graphic shit you can’t imagine sitting here alone
In my room, tryna keep my composure ’cause I seen
Police say a security guard got poked in the neck, got put to sleep
Lord can't save him, but hey, maybe there is more to what we see
Who had that needle?
Was there people there just plotting evil things?
Nah, this ain’t no diss to Travis, pray to God that he’s sincere

With his apology, ’cause I believe the truth will be revealed
I’m just saying, how we see it on the outside isn’t clear
Praying for those who’s affected from that night, know God is there
